                </div>
                <p>The majority of Subnautica's narrative occurs before you arrive, as a backdrop mystery that unfolds as you explore and interact with its vast, strange universe. As a result, despite the fact that they set so much in action, the big actors are seldom seen or heard from.</p>

                    <h3>The Precursors and Kharaa</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Around a thousand years ago, an alien species known as the Precursors were exploring many worlds until they became ill and died from a bacterial sickness known as Kharaa. Desperate for a cure, the Precursors travelled across the galaxy, examining various life forms in the hope of discovering a foundation for a cure or vaccination.</p>

                    <h3>Planet 4546B and the Sea Emperor Leviathan</h3>
                </div>
                <p>When the Precursors were exploring Planet 4546B, the greatest lifeform on that world, a giant telepathic race called the Sea Emperor Leviathans, created a substance called Enzyme 42 that effectively rendered them immune to the deadly Kharaa. The Precursors imprisoned a female Emperor in the Primary Containment Facility and kidnapped seven of her eggs for research in the hopes of extracting this valuable enzyme.</p>

                    <h3>The Failed Experiment</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Unfortunately for the Precursors, the Emperor Leviathan they captured was incapable of assisting them. Because of its age, the Enzyme 42 it generated was insufficient to cure them of the Kharaa, only to lessen its effects for a short time. They attempted to force two of the eggs to hatch prematurely in the hopes of obtaining a fresh supply of the drug, but only killed the embryos in the process, unable to hear the Emperor's telepathic pleas telling them that this would not work and that the eggs could not hatch on command as they desired.</p>

            <div class="content-info" id="content-info-5">

                    <h3>The Dragon Attack and the Release of the Kharaa</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Recognizing their error, the Precursors adopted a different strategy, snatching an egg from a similar creature called the Sea Dragon Leviathan in the hope that it would be genetically near enough to give the cure they need.</p>
                <p>They never had the opportunity to find out. Emperor Leviathans were calm, intellectual beings, but Dragon Leviathans were gigantic, lethal hunters, and the egg's parent attacked the Disease Research Facility in a desperate attempt to reclaim its child. The facility was devastated, and Kharaa was discharged into the waters of 4546B, ultimately poisoning the whole planet. The Precursors realized they couldn't stay safe in such an environment and fled, declaring a worldwide quarantine and leaving behind the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, a massive gun turret designed to automatically shoot down any ships entering or leaving the atmosphere, all in an attempt to keep the Kharaa from spreading any further than it already had.</p>

                    <h3>The Devastation of Planet 4546B</h3>
                </div>
                <p>The spread of Kharaa nearly devastated the Planet. The Kharaa destroyed most of 4546B's species, and many more perished as a result of infection, including every Sea Emperor Leviathan except the one imprisoned in the Primary Containment Facility.</p>
                <p>Unable to flee and appalled by the devastation, the Emperor attempted to alleviate the damage by telepathically instructing the small Peeper fish that swim in and out of the facility to disseminate Enzyme 42 around the world. It wasn't enough to eradicate the Kharaa virus, but it did allow certain lifeforms to adapt and mutate into new species capable of surviving in this drastically changed environment. Planet 4546B, abandoned and destroyed by the Precursors, would remain silent for over a thousand years, attempting to recover from what had been done to it.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Hundreds of years later, in the late 22nd Century, mankind has colonized space when a small spacecraft named the Degasi gets too close to Planet 4546B and is shot down by the automated Quarantine Enforcement Platform, which is still operational after all this time. Three of the plane's six passengers are killed in the disaster, and the other passengers are trapped, including an influential Mongolian CEO called Paul Torgal. The three survivors contract Kharaa and are killed in a variety of horrifying ways before they can call for aid or flee, either by ocean creatures or succumbing to the disease.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Ten years later, a massive starship named the Aurora is traveling over the same location, ostensibly to construct something called a Phasegate, but in truth it's looking for the remnants of Torgal and the Degasi. Again, the Aurora is shot down by the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, and here is where we enter the tale, as a lowly engineer called Ryley Robinson who survives in an escape pod and must try to find a route off-world.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Soon after the crash, a spacecraft called the Sunbeam telephones Ryley and vows to aid, only to be fired down by that stupid Platform, killing everyone on board and making it apparent to the player that if you ever want to escape, you must first turn off those guns. At the same time, Ryley begins to find the Precursors' abandoned technologies and facilities and receives telepathic signals from the imprisoned Emperor Leviathan. He also realizes that he has been infected by the Kharaa, which means he can't leave without first treating himself, partially to prevent the virus from spreading, but also because the Quarantine Enforcement Platform would not allow admission to anybody who is sick.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Ryley is summoned telepathically inside the Primary Containment Facility, where he meets the Emperor Leviathan, who requests him to recover the stolen eggs and deliver them to her, along with particular plants that would eventually cause them to hatch. Ryley learns about the source of the illness, the history of the Precursors, and what the hell that enormous laser that keeps blasting things out of the air is.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Ryley travels to all four corners of the ocean in search of plants and eggs, bringing them back to the Emperor where they ultimately hatch, unleashing a fresh supply of the enzyme that heals Ryley and begins to purify the ocean of Kharaa. The infants depart the facility, their mother momentarily playing with them before succumbing to old age, and Ryley shuts down the Quarantine Enforcement Platform, allowing him to flee with a rocket he constructs from blueprints found on the wreckage of the Aurora. As he walks away, the Emperor telepathically bids him farewell with the last of its might, implying that they are both leaving together.</p>
